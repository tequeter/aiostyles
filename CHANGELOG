tweak some access-restrictions for base- and bikemap -- work in progress
path and track not per default unpaved
if unpaved they are not usable for routing
bicycle-routing for path should be excluded with bicycle=no, if 
width<=2.0 metres
track should be not routable if tracktype <=3

AIO-Bikemap
cycleroute highlighted
motorway and trunk nonroutable types
